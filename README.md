# Laptop-Price-Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset containing information about various laptop models and their prices. The goal is to explore the relationships between different features and the price of laptops, and to build predictive models for estimating laptop prices using regression techniques and ensemble learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- Manufacturer
- Category
- Screen
- GPU
- OS
- CPU_core
- Screen_Size_cm
- CPU_frequency
- RAM_GB
- Storage_GB_SSD
- Weight_pounds
- Price

## Analysis and Modeling

The project includes the following steps:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Handling missing data
3. Data standardization
4. Visualizing relationships between features and price
5. Simple linear regression
6. Multiple linear regression
7. Feature selection
8. Ensemble learning
